🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis on Walmart Sales Data 📊

I recently conducted a deep dive into Walmart's sales data, uncovering valuable insights about weekly sales trends across different stores and external factors like holidays and economic indicators. By using advanced techniques like correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and pivot tables, I was able to analyze the relationship between variables like fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment.

🔍 Key Insights:

Holiday Impact: Holidays showed similar sales patterns to non-holiday weeks with more consistent values.
Store Performance: Significant variation in sales across stores, highlighting top performers.
Economic Indicators: No strong linear relationship between sales and factors like fuel prices and CPI, suggesting other influencing factors.
This analysis provides a solid foundation for future predictive modeling and optimization strategies. 📈
